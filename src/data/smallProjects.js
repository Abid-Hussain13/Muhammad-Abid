         with React, custom hooks, and local storage for persistent state. Users can search for movies via an external API,
          view details, and add them to their watched list with personal ratings. The app also provides a summary of watched
           movies, including total runtime and average ratings. With dynamic rendering, error handling, and a responsive 
           interface, it offers a simple yet powerful way to organize and reflect on movies watched.`,

                       and book events while preventing double-bookings. Admins can view and manage all 
                       bookings, while users see their own. Features include secure authentication, 
                       session handling, and real-time flash messages for feedback.`,

                        I built Inkspire using Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB.

                         dynamic interface powered by EJS templates. Posts are stored in MongoDB,
                          ensuring persistence and easy retrieval. This project highlights my ability
                           to build CRUD-based full-stack applications with database integration and a focus on user-friendly design.`,

                    In Scary Catch, scary plants fall from the top of the screen, and the player 
                    must eliminate them before they reach the base line. The game features a freeze 
                    crystal mechanic that temporarily pauses the screen, giving players extra time 
                    to react. Each plant falls with a dynamic speed, adding challenge and competitiveness. 
                    Players start with three lives, and every successful hit earns 10 points, making the 
                    game both exciting and skill-driven.`,
