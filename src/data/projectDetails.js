                        development. The app will be a Spotify clone but with extra
              features and a modern user interface. The UI was designed by me
              using Figma, and I tried to make it superior to the official
              Spotify website. We use Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind as our
              main technologies. Here is a link to an in-development preview of
              the app (~10% finished): coda-orpin`,
