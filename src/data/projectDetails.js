                        I built SqueezeBook using Node.js, Express, EJS, Postgres and Passport.js for Authentication. The app allows users to add books by ISBN, automatically fetch book details. It focuses on simplicity, with a clean UI and dynamic rendering using EJS templates. The backend ensures smooth data management while providing a structured way to keep track of books read and insights gained.`,
