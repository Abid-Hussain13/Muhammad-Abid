                        I built SqueezeBook using Node.js, Express, EJS, Postgres and Passport.js for Authentication. The app allows users to add books by ISBN, automatically fetch book details. It focuses on simplicity, with a clean UI and dynamic rendering using EJS templates. The backend ensures smooth data management while providing a structured way to keep track of books read and insights gained.`,

        WorldWise is built with React, React Router, Context API, and Leaflet for interactive maps. 
        Users can sign in, mark cities on a world map, add notes, and update visit dates. It also provides a 
        dedicated view of all visited countries, with the option to delete any city. A “current position” 
        feature makes it easy to log the present location instantly. The app focuses on an intuitive map-based 
        interface and dynamic rendering for a smooth user experience, offering a structured way to remember 
        and share travel adventures.`,
